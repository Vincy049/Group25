## Abstract
Sign language is an incredible advancement that has grown over the
years. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks that have come along
with this language. Not everyone knows how to interpret a sign
language when having a conversation with a deaf and dumb person.
There is always a need to communicate using sign language. One
finds it hard to communicate without an interpreter. To solve this, we
need a product that is versatile and robust. We need to convert the
sign language so that it is understood by common people and will
help them to communicate without any barriers.
The main objective of this project is to recognize the gestures and
display the corresponding word. The first phase involves capturing
the gesture using a webcam. The
webcam captures the image and image is processed using pre-processing techniques.The webcam captures the
image and after the preprocessing and feature extraction, the images are got. 
These images are fed into for training. After the training phase, recognition is done and corresponding english text 
& speech is obtained.
Then using translator API, the initial output is converted into regional language text and speech output. 
Therefore, the system, when provided with
the proper gestures, gives out the corresponding words.
